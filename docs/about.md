I am a systems architect working in the California State civil service. I have 30 years of IT experience in a wide range of roles, including IT trainer, software developer, team lead, and, more recently, IT architect. These days, most of my coding is done as a hobbyist, which is, I assure you, much more pleasant than my day job. 

Now, for the standard disclaimer:

Should you chose to act on advice within these pages, know that they are are opinions freely offered (i.e. not my professional opinion) and as such without warranty or guarantee of fitness for purpose. You have been warned._

That said, I hope you find something useful here.
