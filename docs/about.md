I am a systems architect working in the California State civil service. I have 30 years of IT experience in a wide range of roles, including IT trainer, software developer, team lead, and, more recently, IT architect. These days, most of my coding is done as a hobbyist, which is, I assure you, much more pleasant than my day job.
